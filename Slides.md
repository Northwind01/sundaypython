# Hackathons

* Hackathons are not usually about one language or technology
* More about: ideas, exchange, collaboration and experimenation

----

# Impressions

<!-- What I learned so far: -->

* great way to meet curious people
* opportunity to peek into unknown technologies
* awareness, inspiration
* escape work, also: do better work (or worse, sometimes [worse is better](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worse_is_better))
* Python works well for prototyping

----

# Python

* Python is a nice (if you like whitespace), lightweight language
* Python 0.9: February 20, 1991
* Python 3.6.4: December 19, 2017
* In top 5 of [Tiobe Index](https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/), alongside Java and
* an active, heterogeneous community

# Python hard facts

How many lines of code does it take to ...?

* build a web application: 6
* iterate over XML RSS feed items: 3
* parse a URL into a programmable spreadsheet: 1
* state of the art deep learning object detection in images: 16

# Now for real

Let's look at ways to access, inspect, transform, analyze and present data.

----

# Jupyter Notebooks

* CDV18 datasets
* Working with XML
* RSS feeds
* OAI harvesting
* CSV and Excel files
* Python and Art

----

# TODO

Datasets:

* look at example data sets and apis

Where to try Python:

* repl.it

Beautiful Python:

* a [few](https://wiki.python.org/moin/Powerful%20Python%20One-Liners) [one](https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-of-the-most-elegant-greatest-Python-one-liners) [liners](https://gist.github.com/craigls/2712084), 8 queens, ...
* mixed typed arrays, multi paradigm
* list comprehensions, generators

Packages:

* one notebook per package, 5 minutes, 10 packages

<!--

* The data simple format: json - maps to dictionaries
* IPython and Jupyter (g.co/colab)
* working with APIs: requests
* oai: sickle
* tabular data: pandas
* geographic data: geopandas
* basemap, OSM: https://rabernat.github.io/research_computing/intro-to-basemap.html
* deep learning and neural art: keras
* search engine: https://elasticsearch-py.readthedocs.io/en/master/
* scraping: BeautifulSoup
* imaging: Pillow
* working with text: gensim, nltk
* web app: django, flask
